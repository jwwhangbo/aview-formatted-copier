# aview-formatted-copier
A basic copying script that fetches .dcm and .nii.gz files from the source directory and copies them to a target directory in a specific format

I got bored and made a stupid GUI using Tkinter. It looks fancy because I used sv_ttk to cheese the UI to look like something from Microsoft. 
I donâ€™t know why anyone would need to use this, but feel free to use whatever parts of the code

Here's some pics
